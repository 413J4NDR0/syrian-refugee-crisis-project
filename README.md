# Photojournalism and The Syrian Refugee Crisis

This is a website I programmed for a Summer 2017 Duke University Data+ Project on our findings regarding the usage and portrayal of Associated Press photographs depicting the Syrian Refugee Crisis by media outlets. My contributions to this project consisted of:

- Engineering a scalable Java application that interfaced with the AP Photos database, conducted reverse image searches for articles using AP images featuring Syrian refugees, and compiled article text into a database

- Programming this site that contains the results of the semantic text analysis I performed in R, and interactive JavaScript visualizations I programmed for this project
