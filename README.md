This is a website I programmed for a Summer 2017 Duke University Data+ Project that sought to analyze how images of Syrian refugees . My contributions to this project consisted of:

- Engineering a scalable Java application that interfaces with the AP Photos database, conducts reverse image searches for articles using AP images featuring Syrian refugees, and compiles article text into a database

- Programming this site that contains the results of the semantic text analysis I performed in R, and interactive visualizations that contextualize the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the coverage of the crisis by news agencies I programmed in JavaScript
