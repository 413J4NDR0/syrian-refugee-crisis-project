# Visualizing Suffering: Photojournalism and The Syrian Refugee Crisis

This is a website designed and programmed by Alejandro Ortega for a Summer 2017 Duke University Data+ Project on our findings regarding the usage of Associated Press photographs depicting the Syrian Refugee Crisis by media outlets. Unfortunately, due to copyright issues with the AP, the photos are not available to the public. All data visualizations were designed and programmed by Alejandro Ortega. The entire website was built from the ground up.
