        <p class="text">
            The primary data source for this Data+ project is the <a href="http://www.apimages.com/" style="color:black; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none">
                Associated Press Photograph Database
            </a>,
            which is accessible to Duke University students through a license with Duke Libraries. This database uses a keyword search to facilitate queries, as well as a few
            advanced search options. As a baseline, our group used the Google Trends result mentioned in the Introduction to limit our search to photos taken in the time period
            of June 2015 to May 2017; that is, from the months leading up to the Alan Kurdi photo to the beginning of the project.
            The final search queried the term &ldquo;syrian refugee&rdquo; during the above timeframe, resulting in 85 pages and about 5,000 photos.

        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The initial data collection process was completed using
            the open-source Java web scraping library <b>jsoup</b>. At its core, the jsoup library provides methods that can extract
            HTML elements through their tag or CSS selector, and provide access to their attributes and innerHTML. Using this library and supplementary python code,
            we were able to scrape the following:
            <ul style="margin-left:10%;font-size:18px">
                <li>the URL containing the image;</li>
                <li>the photographer;</li>
                <li>the caption text</li>
                <li>the date the image was taken;</li>
                <li>the latitude and longitude of the photo&rsquo;s location;</li>
                <li>the unique ID given by the Associated Press</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p class="text">
            From the unique ID, it was found that there were about 1,300 duplicate images; these duplicate images were removed, resulting in a final
            data set of 3,639 unique images featuring Syrian refugees photographed during June 2015 to May 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Initial exploratory analyses were conducted in the <b>R</b> language, which included image distribution by country
            using the Leaflet Package for R Studio, sentiment analysis of the caption using the Tidy Text Package, and word clouds using the Word Cloud 2 Package.
            Of these exploratory analyses, only word clouds were included in our final visualizations.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Following these exploratory visualizations, we used the jsoup library to conduct Reverse Google Image searches of all 3,639 images to find articles
            that cited these images and scrape their URLs.
            After compiling all the Google Reverse Image results, we proceeded to scrape the text of the articles.
            Of the 3,639 total images, 579 images were published in 650 articles from the eight news agencies of interest. The scraped text of these articles were
            used to create the word clouds in the News Outlets section and word frequency graphs in the Conclusion section.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Data visualization then became the focus of the project. After investigating third party visualizations, it was decided that
            creating our own website and visualizations would be the most effective option. <b>JQuery</b> is ubiquitous across all visualizations.
            <b>Raphael JS</b> is used to handle
            the SVG elements in the Map, Migration Route and Media Outlet Sections. <b>Velocity JS</b> is used to animate SVG elements in the
            Map and News Outlet Sections. All visualizations were designed and programmed specifically for this project.
        </p>
        <p class="text" style="padding-bottom:150px">
            A small scale survey was conducted using Google Forms. The survey has five randomly selected images that were published and
            five that were not published, and asks respondent to gauge the emotional impact of the images and a guess for whether the image was published.
            Originally sent to other groups in the Data+ program, the survey has been integrated into the website for potential visitors to take.
