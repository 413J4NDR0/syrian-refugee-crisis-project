            At the early stages of my career when I was covering a war zone I used to photograph the obvious things, the destruction, the rubble, the funerals.
            However, along the way I started thinking <b style="color:black">deeper than the obvious</b>, searching for the invisible images, stories to document and tell within these
            war zones, and who are the most affected in these war zones: <b style="color:black">the people</b>.

        <p class="text">
            On 2 September 2015,  three-year-old Alan Kurdi’s lifeless body was photographed on the shores of Turkey’s Mediterranean coast
            after his family’s overcrowded boat capsized in the Aegean Sea. By 3 September, the photograph became currency in the realm of mass
            media, gaining exposure in news circuits and social media circles. Though the Syrian Civil War had been festering the previous four and a half
            years, the escalating refugee crisis was largely neglected by the international community. This image brought
            the crisis to the forefront of international discourse by augmenting the dialogue with a human dimension:
            the Syrian Refugee Crisis became a human issue on an international scale.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Within days, this shift in the media narrative was reflected in the previously indifferent political narrative. Politicians across Europe
            cited the image in their decisions to welcome Syria’s refugees: 2 days after the photo’s publication, Germany agreed to open their
            borders to thousands of refugees stranded in Hungary; 4 days after, British Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to accept 4,000 refugees
            every year until 2020; 19 days after, the European Union developed a resolution to resettle the 120,000 refugees stranded in Greece and Italy
            (Kingsly).
            Since the photo’s publication, the term “Syrian Refugee Crisis” cemented its place in news media, reflected by a surge of interest in
            Google Search Trends.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            However, as memories of the Alan Kurdi photo began to fade, so did the compassion. Hungary completed the construction of their southern border fence
            by the end of 2015, stifling the refugee flow; eventually, the Balkan route was officially severed as countries throughout Southeastern Europe closed their
            borders, though many refugees continued to cross with ever-increasing peril. The EU-Turkey migration resolution of March 2016 allows the immediate deportation of irregular 
            migrants back to Greece. Right-wing nationalism swept across Europe, redefining the refugee narrative to one of fear and division (Kingsly).

            The fundamental question this project asks is: <b>
                How has photojournalism in Western media influenced our understanding of
                the refugee crisis, and what are the long term impacts of these photographs?
            </b>

            Google Trends data from June 2015 to May 2017 for the topic European Migrant Crisis.
            There was a massive surge in popularity for this topic from 30 August to 19 September, coinciding with the Alan Kurdi photo, before trailing off once again.

            This Duke University Data+ project tracked photojournalism on the Syrian Refugee Crisis, one of the greatest humanitarian issues of the 21st Century.
            Using the Associated Press Photograph database, we sought to create data visualizations that communicate which stories have been disseminated
            by Western news agencies. A 2014 Pew Research Center report analyzed media outlets by the
            political leanings of their readership, and the following eight news agencies were chosen by our group to represent the full political spectrum:
            <b>The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, NBC, CNN, The BBC, The Guardian, and FOX News</b>. <br /> <br /> For more detailed
            information, please visit our <a href="methodology.html" style="color:black; text-decoration:none; font-weight:bold;">Methodologies</a> section.
